Hello I'm <em style="color: #333" >TheRockSays</em>, a brazilian guy persona/alter ego.\
I'm a mainly a web developer with a dream of being a game developer.

## Web Development

Primarily i'm a Java Web Developer, but i have some experience with Python Web Development, and i'm also a Ruby lover, so i have some knowledge on Ruby/Ruby on Rails.

### Java

As a Java developer i have to know about Spring Framework and its projects.

I'm also aware of frameworks like [JUnit 4/5](https://junit.org/junit5) with [Mockito](https://site.mockito.org/) for testing, [Log4j2](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/) for logging, [Google Guava](https://github.com/google/guava) libraries, and the [Project Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) for boilerplate code.

### Python

Since Python is not my primary language, i only know about its main framework like Django and Flask, but i'm focused in Django.
